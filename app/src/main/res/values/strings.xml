        This paint job calculator computes the approximate number
        of gallons needed to paint a single coat covering four walls
         and the ceiling of an interior room.
        \n\n
        If you wish to apply multiple coats, multiply the number of
        computed gallons by the number of coats needed.  You must
        provide the dimensions of the room as well as the number of
         doors and windows.
        \n\n
        The input for the dimensions of the room will be the length,
         width, and height of the room.  In addition, you must also
         provide the number of doors and windows in the room; their
         area will not be included in the surface area to be painted.
         \n\n
         This calculator assumes a door is a standard measurement of
         7 x 3 feet and a window is a standard measurement of 4 x 4
         feet.
         \n\n
         A gallon of paint will cover approximately 275 square feet.
